### Unix, Linux, and Windows Command Prompt Redirection

*Redirecting Input*

eg. we compile `echo_eof.c` program and place the exe version in a file called `echo_eof`to run the program type the exe name:

`echo_eof`

This takes input from keyboard.

Lets say we want input from a `text` file called `words`, to do this just run:

`echo_eof < words`
